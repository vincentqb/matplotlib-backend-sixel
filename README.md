# matplotlib-backend-sixel

This python module allows you to use your [sixel-enabled terminal](https://www.arewesixelyet.com/) to show inline plots generated by python's [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib).

This is forked from [ctorney](https://github.com/ctorney/matplotlib-backend-sixel) with patch from [yimuchen](https://github.com/yimuchen/matplotlib-backend-sixel/tree/changing-backend). The module is a modified version of the [kitty backend](https://github.com/jktr/matplotlib-backend-kitty) and is also based on this earlier [sixel backend](https://github.com/jonathf/matplotlib-sixel).

To install

```
pip install matplotlib-backend-sixel
```

Configure matplotlib to use the module by either setting the environment variable `MPLBACKEND` to `module://matplotlib-backend-sixel` or by initializing matplotlib as follows.

```python
import matplotlib

matplotlib.use("module://matplotlib-backend-sixel")

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

If you've installed this module correctly, you can now use the following sample code to draw a plot in your terminal.

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib

matplotlib.use('module://matplotlib-backend-sixel')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.style.use("dark_background")

t = np.linspace(0,5,200)
plt.fill_between(t,np.sin(t),np.cos(2*t),alpha=0.5)
plt.fill_between(t,np.cos(t),np.sin(2*t),alpha=0.5)

plt.show()
# <plot is shown>
```

If you set your matplotlib to interactive mode via `matplotlib.pyplot.ion()` or by running python as `python -i`, non-empty figures are drawn on construction where possible. This allows you to use pandas' `plot()` calls directly, without calling `plt.show()`, and still enables you to manually construct and `plt.show()`.

If your matplotlib is in non-interactive mode, you can construct your figures as usual, and then call `plt.show()` to render them to your terminal. This works from both a repl and when running scripts.

Internally, this backend is somewhat based on matplotlib's IPython support: it's a hybrid of image and GUI backend types. It works by using matplotlib's `Agg` backend to render the plot, and then calls `python-sixel` to convert to sixel format and then cat the image to your terminal. This means that plotting works as expected, but the image drawn to your terminal isn't interactive and animations aren't supported.
